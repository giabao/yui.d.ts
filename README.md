yui.d.ts
========

typescript definition type for [yui3](https://github.com/yui/yui3).

The definition is based on [yui 3.14.0](version https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/release-3.14.0).

I create it only for writing test files of [cryptojs.d.ts](https://github.com/giabao/cryptojs.d.ts/tree/master/test).
So, the definition is incomplete (22/11/2013).
But if anyone want to create a (full) definition type for yui3, then I think this repo is a good reference
